# Self Organising Multi Agent Systems 2022

##NB: if using testing script, you need to comment out AGENT_TEAM3_QUANTITY and AGENT_RANDOM_QUANTITY in the `.env` file. 

## [Specifications](spec.pdf)



## Programming Language

* Download [GoLang](https://go.dev/dl/) (1.19)

### Get Started

* [GoLang Get Started](https://go.dev/learn/)

## Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:SOMAS2022/SOMAS2022.git
cd SOMAS2022
make
```
If running a team experiment, eg for team 0, set the `MODE` env variable in `.env`
```
MODE=0
```
## Project Structure

Following some Golang Standards [[1]](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
, [[2]](https://medium.com/sellerapp/golang-project-structuring-ben-johnson-way-2a11035f94bc) and previous year project
structures ([2021](https://github.com/SOMAS2021/SOMAS2021))

## Project Management

* Use [Github Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to track tasks, deadlines, assignees, project progress etc.

## Contribution Guidelines

A lot of these guidelines are from the [SOMAS2021](https://github.com/SOMAS2021/SOMAS2021/blob/main/README.md)
and [SOMAS2020](https://github.com/SOMAS2020/SOMAS2020/blob/main/docs/SETUP.md) repos :)

### Coding Rules

1. You're encouraged to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with
   the [Go extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go).
2. Trust the language server. Red lines == death. Yellow lines == close to death. An example where it might be very
   tempting to let yellow lines pass are in `struct`s:

```golang
type S struct {
    name string
    age  int
}
s1 := S {"pitt", 42} // NO
s2 := S {"pitt"} // NO (even though it initialises age to 0)
s3 := S{name: "pitt", age: 42} // OK, if we add fields into S, this will still be correct
s4 := S{name: "pittson"} // OK if `pittson`'s age is 0
```

3. Write tests where required. There are many guides online on how to do this in Golang. Tests will be run alongside CI
   when you pull into the main repo. If anyone breaks anything, it's easy to observe that if you have tests. Otherwise,
   your code will be broken unknowingly.

4. DO NOT TOUCH code you don't own unless you have a good reason to. If you have a good reason to, do it in a separate
   PR and notify the owners of the code.

5. Do not use `panic` or `die` - return an `error` instead!

6. Do not use system-specific packages (e.g. `internal/syscall/unix`).

7. Use the superior `errors.Errorf` to create your errors so that we have a stack trace.

### Code Reviews and PRs

- Do not push to the `main` branch. Make your own branch and create a PR into `main` when it's ready for review.
- When working on your own team's features, please name your branch as: `teamX-FEATURE_NAME-WHATEVER_YOU_LIKE_HERE`
- Do not use force push. Use `git push --force-with-lease` instead.
- When ready to merge into your team's feature branch, create a PR to merge into `teamX-FEATURE_NAME`. When the feature
  is complete, then create a PR into `main`.
- Make sure that you have reviewed your own code before creating the PR.
- Keep PRs small and include a description of what's been covered on your PR. This ensures they can be reviewed
  properly.
- You need to make sure your code is up-to-date with the `main` branch. Merge commits are *not
  allowed*: [learn how to rebase](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35901915/how-to-rebase-after-squashing-commits-in-the-original-branch/70994400#70994400)
  .
- Do not review your own code. That completely defeats the purpose of code review.
- Team leads: when doing a PR for your team's code, do not approve it yourself - get another team lead to review it.
- Review PRs in a timely manner! Ideally by the next day so that other teams aren't blocked.
- If you create a PR, use the "assign" feature on the PR to assign who should be merging it once the review is
  completed (this can be you)
- If you are a reviewer, do not merge in PRs that are not assigned to you once you finish reviewing.
